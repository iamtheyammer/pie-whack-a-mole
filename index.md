## Project Description
Whack-A-Mole is a well loved game that puts a player's reflexes to the test. Over the course of 30 seconds, moles pop up and the user only has a split second to whack the top before it disappears beneath the board. The game is enhanced with a score board that rewards the players with each hit and a leaderboard for some friendly competition. Overall, the game is fun and a great stress reliever for any player that steps up to the challenge.

## Project Goals
MVP:
1. Six moles randomly going up and down using a pneumatic system
2. When moles are hit, score is calculated for the player
3. A monitor that displays score
